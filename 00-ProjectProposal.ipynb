    "Sleep is an important process for cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, and physical health. Hence, understanding the factors that may influence how people sleep is important for both clinical research and public health interventions. Current research has identified certain externally influenceable factors in one’s lifestyle such as physical activity, screentime and chosen profession.\n",

    "Xu et al examined the relationship between Physical activity, self-reported screen time, and sleep quantity and quality. This study looks at a sample of 1136 adolescents aged 16-19  from the 2005–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) as this is a less common age group studied in such research. They used an accelerometer, a wearable device to estimate physical activity and self-reported data for screen time, sleep quality and quantity for 30 days. They found that meeting recommended screen time guidelines was associated with significantly lower odds of reporting poor sleep quality, and that adolescents who met both physical activity and screen time guidelines had even lower odds of poor sleep, especially among males [1]. These results illustrate that modifiable behaviors like screen time and physical activity are linked to self‑rated sleep quality and may interact differently depending on intrinsic factors such as the sex and behavior of the individual.\n",

    "Bailey et al aimed to categorise data from Fitbit devices collected from 30,445 participants in the All of Us Research Program. This Program is a national effort to enroll more than 1 million participants for health research. It enables participants to donate Fitbit data, providing a unique dataset for physical activity (PA) and sleep research. For this study, days 15–21 post consent date were selected for analysis of demographic characteristics, wear days, and wear time proxy variables such as heart rate for amount of physical activity [2]. This study demonstrated another way to quantify variations in physical activity and perhaps sleep patterns other than surveys.\n",

    "Nelson et al examined how work demands influence sleep among nearly 3,000 adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) cohort. The researchers assessed multiple aspects of job demands such as intensity, role conflict and job control, finding that there were significant linear and quadratic relationships between job demands and sleep outcomes. The linear effects indicated that participants with higher job demands had worse sleep health, such as shorter duration, greater irregularity, greater inefficiency, and more sleep dissatisfaction. The quadratic effects indicated that sleep regularity and efficiency outcomes were the best when participants’ job demands were moderate rather than too low or too high [3]. These findings illustrate how variables like occupational stress and control may intersect with both internal and external influences on sleep quality in real-world populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these studies provide important insights, most rely on self-reported sleep measures and cross-sectional designs which introduce potential biases [1][3]. Nonetheless, they provide a strong foundation for examining how individual characteristics and lifestyle behaviors together influence perceived sleep quality, which is the focus of the present project.\n",

    "Adults who engage in higher levels of daytime physical activity tend to exhibit higher sleep quality compared to less physically active adults. This relationship is expected because physical activity influences multiple physiological mechanisms involved in sleep regulation, including circadian rhythm, human thermoregulation (body temperature regulation), and autonomic nervous system balance. Exercise promotes declines in core body temperature, which facilitates sleep onset, and reduces hyperarousal (chronic “fight-or-flight” response)\n",
    "by modulating cortisol levels and enhancing parasympathetic activity (when nerves relax the body). Additionally, physical activity contributes to the reduction of psychological stress while increasing the release of endorphins and other chemicals in the brain associated with improved mood and emotional regulation. Collectively, these effects support longer sleep duration, greater sleep efficiency, and improved sleep continuity in physically active individuals compared to those with less active lifestyles.\n",

    "   ### A. What variables are needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "   We need to be able to test the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality. Ideal datasets would include quantitative measures of daily physical activity and sleep outcomes for adults, hopefully within a similar age range.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Physical activity variables could include:**\n",
    "   - Step count  \n",
    "   - Minutes of moderate/vigorous activity  \n",
    "   - Calories burned  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Sleep variables could include:**\n",
    "   - Total sleep duration  \n",
    "   - Total REM sleep  \n",
    "   - Sleep quality score  \n",
    "   - Self-reported restfulness after waking  \n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   ### B. How many observations are needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "   An ideal dataset would include at least several hundred observations to allow for meaningful statistical analysis and visualization. Anything less than that is not very statistically significant. A larger sample size would be very helpful if we are able to get one. If we are not able to get large datasets the next step would be to try and analyze multiple smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ### C. Who / what / how would these data be collected?\n",
    "\n",
    "   The data would ideally be collected by wearable sleep monitors such as:\n",
    "   - Smart watches  \n",
    "   - Fitness trackers  \n",
    "\n",
    "   For fitness variables, data should be collected via survey every day (or collected from wearables daily), with data collected over multiple days at a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ### B. How would these data be stored/organized?\n",
    "\n",
    "   The data would ideally be stored in a structural way that allows us to interface with the data via tools discussed in class, such as csv files or some sort of relational database. Each row would represent a single observation for one individual with columns representing specific variables such as sleep quality, age, occupation, activity levels, etc. For extremely large databases something like PostgreSQL or MySQL would be nice with seperate tables for participant information, acitivty data, and sleep data but it is unlikely we will find such a database based on research conducted thus far.\n",

    "   This is a PubMed journal with data tables giving the relationship between sleep quality and physical activity (there are other variables but we will not need them). Since this is a PubMed journal, it does not natively give CSV files for the data, but we will be able to export the data tables in CSV format via pandas. This dataset is almost ideal. However, it only includes individuals aged 16–19, so we need to take that into consideration.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data will be taken from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (NHANES). The participants gave informed consent at the time of the survey and data collection. They answered questions through household interviews and physical examinations at Mobile examination centers. In one section of data collection, respondents were asked to wear accelerometer which suggests it was a voluntary choice and only respondents with more than 4 days of 10+ hears each day were considered. These participates voluntarily engaged in different intensities of physical workouts.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    ">The dataset is representative of US adolescents aged between 16 to 19 years old. There were 10348 respondents, from which 542 have missing values which will be excluded without influencing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII), for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> The University of Rhode Island Institutional Review has determined the data as de-identified and public. To further minimize risk, we will only be using variables necessary for our analysis and are generic. The risk of reidentifying this data from other datasets leading to identification of the person is minimal. \n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> The data includes demographic variables like race/ethnicity. However, depending on our further analysis, we may or may not use these variables.\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> As this is public and de-identified dataset, individuals will have to request the original contributors to remove their data.\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    ">The dataset is representative of US adolescents aged between 16 to 19 years old. There were 9806 non-missing data respondents. It might not be representative of certain subgroups such as those with chronic illnesses. \n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
