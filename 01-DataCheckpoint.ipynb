    "Sleep is an important process for cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, and physical health. Hence, understanding the factors that may influence how people sleep is important for both clinical research and public health interventions. Current research has identified certain externally influenceable factors in one’s lifestyle such as physical activity, screentime, chosen profession and use of drugs such as alcohol. We aim to observe the interaction between sleep quality and such factors through this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Xu et al examined the relationship between Physical activity, self-reported screen time, and sleep quantity and quality. This study looks at a sample of 1136 adolescents aged 16-19  from the 2005–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) as this is a less common age group studied in such research. They used an accelerometer, a wearable device to estimate physical activity and self-reported data for screen time, sleep quality and quantity for 30 days. They found that meeting recommended screen time guidelines was associated with significantly lower odds of reporting poor sleep quality, and that adolescents who met both physical activity and screen time guidelines had even lower odds of poor sleep, especially among males [1]. These results illustrate that modifiable behaviors like screen time and physical activity are linked to self‑rated sleep quality and may interact differently depending on intrinsic factors such as the sex and behavior of the individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bailey et al aimed to categorise data from Fitbit devices collected from 30,445 participants in the All of Us Research Program. This Program is a national effort to enroll more than 1 million participants for health research. It enables participants to donate Fitbit data, providing a unique dataset for physical activity (PA) and sleep research. For this study, days 15–21 post consent date were selected for analysis of demographic characteristics, wear days, and wear time proxy variables such as heart rate for amount of physical activity [2]. This study demonstrated another way to quantify variations in physical activity and sleep patterns other than surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nelson et al examined how work demands influence sleep among nearly 3,000 adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) cohort. The researchers assessed multiple aspects of job demands such as intensity, role conflict and job control, finding that there were significant linear and quadratic relationships between job demands and sleep outcomes. The linear effects indicated that participants with higher job demands had worse sleep health, such as shorter duration, greater irregularity, greater inefficiency, and more sleep dissatisfaction. The quadratic effects indicated that sleep regularity and efficiency outcomes were the best when participants’ job demands were moderate rather than too low or too high [3]. These findings illustrate how variables like occupational stress and control may intersect with both internal and external influences on sleep quality in real-world populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Studies also show strong concurrence between insomnia and alcoholism. Colrain et al reviewed a number of studies involving different research methods from self reported data to EEG scans in order to analyse brain waves indicating different stages of sleep. Alcohol has a profound impact on sleep, with effects dependent on acute versus chronic use and dependence. While alcohol is initially sedating, this effect disappears after a few hours due to decrease in REM sleep. This results in a fragmented and disturbed sleep in the second half of the night. Sustained use of alcohol in chronic alcoholism is associated with major sleep problems [4]. Hence, this study shows multiple ways of gaining data to analyse sleep quality after alcohol use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While these studies provide important insights, most rely on self-reported sleep measures and cross-sectional designs which introduce potential biases [1][3][4]. Nonetheless, they provide a strong foundation for examining how individual characteristics and lifestyle behaviors together influence perceived sleep quality, which is the focus of the present project.\n",

    "(UPDATED HYPOTHESIS) Self-rated sleep quality is influenced by both modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Higher levels of modifiable health behaviors (e.g., greater physical activity and healthier BMI) will be associated with more positive self-reported sleep quality. However, this relationship will be moderated by non-modifiable characteristics such as age and gender. Specifically, the strength and direction of the association between modifiable factors and sleep quality will differ across age groups and between genders, indicating an interaction effect between variables that can be changed and variables that cannot be changed."

    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",

    "   - Gender (female or male)\n",
    "   - BMI (Body Mass Index) in kg/m^2,\n",
    "   - How frequently alcohol is consumed (some of the responses were 1-2 times per week, 5+ times per week, 0 times per week, etc.)\n",
    "   - Walking/bicycling in minutes per day\n",
    "   - How many minutes per day the person was sedentary\n",
    "   - Hours slept on the weekdays and hours slept on the weekend\n",
    "   - Self-rated sleep quality (written as sleepiness (daytime) in the dataset. High daytime sleepiness correlates with low sleep quality, Low daytime sleepiness correlates with high sleep quality) For example, one of the responses was 2-4/month, meaning that the person got 2-4 days of poor quality sleep that month. \n",
    "   - How many cigarettes the person smoked per day/weel (the responses included never, 1 per day, 2-7 per week)\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Some of the major concerns with this database are:\n",
    "   - Self-reported data bias\n",
    "        - Many of the variables in the dataset (i.e. sleep levels, alcohol use, sedentary time, self-rated sleep quality) may not be exactly accurate for each person, which can introduce recall bias (which occurs when participants in a study do not accurately remember a past experience). \n",
    "    - Inconsistent categorical formats\n",
    "        - For example, the frequency of alcohol consumption uses mixed text formats (e.g., 1/day, 2–3/week, 5–6/year, never), which require extensive normalization before analysis.\n",
    "    - Missing contextual variables\n",
    "        - There is no clear information on socioeconomic status, occupation, health conditions, or geographic location, which are important confounders when performing data analysis on this dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
